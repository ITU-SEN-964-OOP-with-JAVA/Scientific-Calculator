# Scientific-Calculator
Class project for ITU SEN964 - OOP with JAVA

1. Project define (Descript projects we are gonna implement)
  * Several reference:
    1. google calculator (https://www.google.com/search?q=scientific+calculator&oq=scientific+calculator&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j69i60j0l2.415j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8)
    2. http://web2.0calc.com/
    3. windows calcultor (May be not good idea, not sure if everyone use windows)
    4. suggestion?
2. Module devide (History, GUI, functions, ...)
  1. which GUI lib to pick? (awt? swing? javafx? ...)
  2. MVC module structure? or anything better?
  3. History can use Array, Stack or Queue. '=' will run previous calculation, can we do it easily with history?
  4. Multiple buttons will be initialized, we might need a button factory to bind buttons with its functions. And a dataset for coordination and outlook of each button.
  5. GUI should also accept keyboard input. how do we design the modules to make this easy to implement?
3. Implementation (Divide and concur)
  * (@TODO)
4. Testing/debugging (Hopefuly, we will have enough time to test all functions)
  * (@TODO)
